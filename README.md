# Typical Quiz
This is a simple quiz app that I built for two reasons:
* To give me more practice with the full app creation workflow
* To have an actual study tool to use in my daily practice of git concepts

Using the app is straight forward. Choose a topic and start learning. 
Basic stats are captured through localstorage and can be viewed on the score screen. The page is mobile friendly, and I often use it while walking to work.
